bu2_OperationArray (CLASS)
    -DESC: An array of variable length meant to represent multiple elements related by an operation (addition, multiplication,
    exponential). This operation is determined by the subclasses: bu2_TermArray (addition), bu2_FactorArray (multiplication),
    and bu2_ExponentArray (exponential)

bu2_ExpressionArray (CLASS)
    -DESC: An operation array with an additional array to specify the equators (= < >) in the problem.

bu2_TermArray (CLASS)
    -DESC: An operation array that represents addition executed from left to right

bu2_FactorArray (CLASS)
    -DESC: An operation array that represents multiplication executed from left to right

bu2_ExponentArray (CLASS)
    -DESC: Ac operation array that represents exponential operations executed from right to left.

bu2_simplify_distribute
    -IN: Any instance of an operation array
    -DESC: Starts by checking for any element in the input that is an operation array previous to it's self (eg. A factor
    array will be looking for term arrays, same for exponent => factor). When it finds one it will

bu2_toMachine_organize

bu2_simplify_surfaceExecute

bu2_simplify_surfaceSolveForVariable
    -IN: An expression array, the mathematical variable meant to solve for.
